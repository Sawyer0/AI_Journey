        <h2>ðŸš€ My AI Journey</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Dawan, and I'm exploring the fascinating intersection of creativity and artificial intelligence. My journey into AI isn't just about coding. But about finding innovative ways to bring my ideas to life.</p>
        
        <div class="journey-highlights">
            <h3>ðŸ’¡ My Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Building:</strong> I use AI as a collaborative partner in coding, helping me structure projects and implement best practices. It's like having a senior developer by my side, guiding me through complex problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> AI assists me in breaking down big ideas into manageable pieces. Whether it's modularizing code or planning new features, it helps me see the bigger picture while keeping track of the details.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> With AI's help, I ensure my projects are robust and reliable. It suggests test cases I might not have thought of and helps me catch potential issues early.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm particularly drawn to projects that blend technology with creative expression. The Matrix Welcome Script is a perfect example â€“ it combines my love for classic sci-fi with modern programming practices. This is just the beginning of my journey to create more immersive, engaging experiences that reflect my unique perspective.</p>
